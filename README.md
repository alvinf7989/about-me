# about-me

  Hello everyone. I'm Alvin Frias and I'm going to tell you everything about me. I am currently using the alvinf14@nycstudents.net email to write this README.md. I chose to enter Software Engineering because I like coding and someday, I wish to make my own video games. The high school I went to was High School of Telecommunications and as a freshmen, I started with Intro to Computer Science. fterwards when becoming a sophomore, I had my first **SEP**  (**Software Engineering Program**) class. I learned about HTML, CSS, AVD elements. I'm currently working on Github units which we are close to finishing. There will also be a Freedom Project after learning all the elements of SEP10. But we're not _there_ yet.
