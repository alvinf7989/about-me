# about-me

  Hello everyone. I'm Alvin Frias and I'm going to tell you everything about me. I am currently using the alvinf14@nycstudents.net email to write this README.md. I chose to enter Software Engineering because I like coding and someday, I wish to make my own video games. The high school I went to was High School of Telecommunications and as a freshmen, I started with Intro to Computer Science. fterwards when becoming a sophomore, I had my first **SEP**  (**Software Engineering Program**) class. I learned about HTML, CSS, AVD elements. I'm currently working on Github units which we are close to finishing. There will also be a Freedom Project after learning all the elements of SEP10. But we're not _there_ yet.

I like this school and SEP so far. I like to play video games (mostly Mario or Nintendo games) and I thought a Technology class would be perfect for me to take steps into creating my own games. During SEP we had to make lots of write ups which I believe help me take more notes, I'll show you all of them right now.

## My Writeups

### Basic Writeups
* [Hyper Text Markup Language](https://github.com/hstatsep-students/sep10-writeups-alvinf7989/blob/main/01-basic-wd/html-writeup.md)

* [Cascading Style Sheets](https://github.com/hstatsep-students/sep10-writeups-alvinf7989/blob/main/01-basic-wd/css-writeup.md)

* [Applied Visual Design](https://github.com/hstatsep-students/sep10-writeups-alvinf7989/blob/main/01-basic-wd/avd-writeup.md)

### Github Writeups
* [Command Line Interface](https://github.com/hstatsep-students/sep10-writeups-alvinf7989/blob/main/02-github/cli-writeup.md)

I will have more in the future and you know what? Now that I've gotten the hang of CLI I'm going to try to put that CLI writeup in here.
